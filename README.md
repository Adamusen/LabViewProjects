# LabViewProjects
some of my projects in LabView

MineBot is a fairly big and complex program. It can solve the good old Minesweeper from windows XP by getting control over your cursor in record speed! (it is there to download as well). Sad I can't open this one anymore, because my UNI licence is expired :(
HF2 is a Houswork I had to make at the University (It's a Mechatronics project)
